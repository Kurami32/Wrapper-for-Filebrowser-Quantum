# Webview wrapper for Filebrowser Quantum
This Android app is a simple WebView wrapper for the [Filebrowser Quantum](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser) project, one of the best self-hosted web-based file managers that ever existed!

## Why I made this app? 
Well, I know that you can currently install [Filebrowser Quantum](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser) as a webapp with your browser.
But at least for me, I donÂ´t like that approach, that's why I made an app. Just for name a few things, I'd like to have separate cookies and browser cache from my main browser, also that I have quick access on my launcher
which is **search-focused**, my launcher don't let me add any "shortcut" to the home screen that the browsers provides. And I think some users might be using a launcher similar to mine, or just those who would like to have it as a native-like app.

I was using this app for personal use before, but I decided make available for everyone :D

> Note: This is my first time doing an app and making a public project on github in general, if there are issues, or something I shouldn't have done, please, contact me. 

## Usage
> Note: You need to have you filebrowser quantum server up and running, please visit the [Filebrowser Quantum repository](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser), If you haven't already.

Is very simple, just download the app from the [releases channel](https://github.com/Kurami32/Wrapper-for-Filebrowser-Quantum/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and install it on you desired device.
When you open the app for the first time, you will have a screen like this:

![Startup_screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7e5f049-dcb6-40cf-a69c-d360b67d0c4a)

Just enter your Filebrowser URL and click on the "save" button. (Don't forget that must contain `http://` or `https://` at the start).

## Features
- Is like any other app that you have on your phone, you can search it if you have a lot of apps with the app drawer of your phone launcher.
- Custom toast notification when uploading or downloading a file.
- Custom screen when there is no connection.
- Improved performance, this is possible thanks to hardware acceleration.
- I plan to add other minor things, like the hability for refresh the page with gestures!

## Important notes:
- How this is a WebView app, please, make sure that you have always up-to-date your webview component. If you are using another webview which is not the [default of Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview&hl=en-US), I'm not sure how the app will behave.
- This is just a wrapper, basically a mini-browser that is just loading a specific URL provided (in this case, your filebrowser domain).
- If you found an issue related to this app, like a crash, the app not responding, etc. Feel free to open an issue here.
- If you found an issue non-related to this app; and is on the website instead, please, go to the [filebrowser project repository](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser), and try to reach the dev there, he is very welcoming :)
