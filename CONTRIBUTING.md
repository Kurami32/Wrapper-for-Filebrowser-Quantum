# Contributing
First of all, thanks if you want contribute to this tiny app!
This is my first attempt creating an android app (even if is just a wrapper). I've could do some mistakes, and I'm sure that something can be improved!

## How to Contribute

### Opening issues
- If you find a bug **related with the app**, you can open an issue. I'll try to fix it if I can.
    - To confirm if is related with the app. Try it first on your browser, and try to reproduce the same there.
- If you want a feature you can also open an issue, but take in count that this is just an webview wrapper, so I can't do much.

### Opening discusions 
About something related with the app :D

### Pull Requests
If you want to implement/improve or fix something. You'll need `git` installed and a IDE/Editor of your choice -- I use android studio. 

1.  **Fork the repository.** (`git clone https://github.com/Kurami32/Wrapper-for-Filebrowser-Quantum.git`)
2.  **Open the project** with your IDE, or the file that you want to change with your editor.
3.  **Create a branch** for your feature/improvement or fix (`git checkout -b <branch-name>`).
4.  **Make your changes.**
5.  **Test your changes.** Ensure that your change works on an emulator or a real device.
6.  **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m '<message with your changes>'`).
7.  **Push to the branch** (`git push origin <your-brach-name>`).
8.  **Open your PR** 

> Note: You can do most of the git operations with your IDE too, but I prefer the CLI way (is more easy for me), so is up to you what do you choose meanwhile you tested that your changes are working.
